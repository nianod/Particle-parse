My sfml source code projects# Particle System with SFML

## Description
A simple interactive particle system implemented in C++ using SFML. Particles respond to gravity and noise, and new particles can be added with mouse clicks.

## Features
- Random particle spawning at start and on mouse clicks
- Gravity effect on particles (configurable)
- Noise/random movement applied to particles
- Basic particle color variation

## Requirements
- C++ Compiler supporting C++11 or higher
- SFML library (version 2.0 or higher)

## Building
1. Install SFML on your system: https://www.sfml-dev.org/download.php
2. Clone this repository
3. Build using your preferred method (e.g., CMake or manual compilation)
   Example using g++:
